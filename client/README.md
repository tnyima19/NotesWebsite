# React client

The code in this directory was initialized with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and uses [react-router 6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [Bootstrap 5.x](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).

## Running the client

> make sure you're in the `/client` folder when running the following commands

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Installing libraries

You can install any react library you want to use in this project. The dependencies in this client are independent of the dependencies of your API backend.

## Making call to your API backend

This client runs on port `3000` by default and the API server should be configured to run on port `8080`.

The create-react-app proxy has been **pre-configured** for these ports, meaning in your code you can make API calls without having to hardcode the port number. For example:

```js
fetch('/api/users/42', { ... })
```

> Note: you should **NOT** hardcode the domain `http://localhost/` in your API calls. If you were to do this, the calls will fail once the app is deployed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
