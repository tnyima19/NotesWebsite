2. Once inside the virtual environment of Venv, run python app.py
3. Then go to frontend folder and run NPM I, NPM start. The code should launch the website.

Comment for Tenzing,

There are a few places with the "backend" name is used for the pathing of the files so you might want to change it so that
its pathing to API not "backend" when you do the merge. I believe it's like that for some react package.json config files too but I don't
know for sure if that matters too much. Same thing for front end. For any questions just message me.
