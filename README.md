#Cs499 Project
This is the layout for the User Login and register aspect of the project, All assets/necessary files and code/and notes should be committed here.

2/8/2024

Currently, I have a rough draft of the login/register. It runs locally currently, before I commit it to our GitHub I'm going to have to put in the 
necessary libraries that are required for it to work. I didn't have time to put it into a folder yet. I'll push it into the GitHub in 2/9 
(afternoon) with the necessary files.

Make sure to read the README.txt file too.
